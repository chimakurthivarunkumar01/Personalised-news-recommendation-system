This project implements a context-aware news recommendation system that delivers relevant news articles to users based on their interests. The system allows users to select a specific news category, 
such as Sports, Business, or Politics, and optionally provide a query to further personalize recommendations. Instead of relying on keyword matching, the system uses semantic understanding of news 
content to recommend articles that are meaningfully related to the user’s intent. The entire system is exposed through a RESTful API using FastAPI, making it suitable for real-time usage.
The dataset used in this project is the News Category Dataset, which is provided in JSON Lines format. It contains news headlines, short descriptions, and corresponding categories. 
Since the dataset includes some malformed JSON entries caused by unescaped quotation marks, a robust line-by-line JSON parsing approach is used. Corrupted records are skipped during ingestion, 
ensuring the data pipeline remains stable and reliable. This approach reflects real-world data engineering practices, where datasets are often noisy and imperfect.

During preprocessing, only the most relevant columns—headline, short description, and category—are retained. The headline and short description are concatenated to form a single text field.This combined 
representation captures both the summary and context of each news article, which significantly improves the quality of semantic embeddings generated later in the pipeline. The processed dataset 
is then divided into training and testing subsets to enable proper evaluation of the recommendation logic.
